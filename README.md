## About Me

I’m a **Software Engineer** with **3+ years of hands-on experience** building fast, scalable, and production-ready web and desktop applications.

As software engineering moves beyond traditional application development, my career has been shaped by **self-directed learning**, **disciplined execution**, and a consistent ability to **adopt and apply emerging technologies quickly**.  
Despite being a college dropout, I built my foundation through real-world problem solving, engineering rigor, and continuous learning.

That same mindset is now driving me toward the **next frontier of computing** the era of **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** and, ultimately, **Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)**.

I enjoy turning ambiguity into well-structured, maintainable systems and continuously pushing my technical boundaries.

##  What I'm Focusing On

- Building **high-performance, end-to-end applications** using modern frameworks and clean architecture
- Deepening expertise in **AWS**, **GCP**, DevOps tooling, and **cloud-native & distributed systems**
- Developing **AI-driven applications and agent-based systems**
- Exploring the long-term implications of **AGI, autonomous agents, and intelligent systems**
- Contributing to **open-source** and impactful side projects
