## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Software Engineer** with over **3 years** of experience building fast, scalable, and production-ready web and desktop applications.  
Despite being a college dropout, I built my foundation through relentless self-learning, engineering discipline, and real-world problem solving.

- 💻 I build clean, efficient frontends using **Angular**, **React**, and **Next.js**.  
- 🦀 I explore desktop applications with **Tauri** and **Rust**.  
- ⚙️ I design robust backend systems with **Express.js**, **Spring Boot**, and **FastAPI**.  
- 🧠 I enjoy taking ambiguous problems and engineering structured, maintainable solutions.  
- ☁️ I’m actively leveling up in **cloud platforms** and **distributed architectures**.

> **"If there's a challenge, I’ll figure it out. If there's a tech I don’t know I’ll learn it."**
