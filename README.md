## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Full Stack Developer** with over **3 years** of hands-on experience crafting fast, scalable, and responsive web and desktop applications. Despite being a college dropout, I've built a strong technical foundation through relentless self-learning and real-world problem solving.

- 💻 I specialize in **Angular**, **React**, and **Next.js** for building sleek frontends.
- 🦀 I explore desktop app development using **Tauri** and **Rust**.
- ⚙️ On the backend, I architect robust APIs using **Express.js** and **Spring Boot**.
- 🧠 I believe in solving real-world problems with clean, maintainable code.
- 🌍 In this fast-moving AI-driven world, I’m always learning and adapting.

> **"If there's a challenge — I’ll figure it out. If there's a tech I don’t know — I’ll learn it. That’s the mindset I bring to every project."**
